# A hybrid multi-objective genetic algorithm for the container loading problem

In this project, we propose to use a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve a single container loading problem, by optimizing the utilized volume, the number, and total value of the contained boxes. Within the framework of the proposed algorithm, a special diploid representation scheme of individuals is used and a modified heuristic packing method, derived from the deepest bottom left with fill (DBLF) packing method, is employed to realize a 3D packing of the boxes.
